# p1Deamon
Read deamon for P1 port (just started...)

As a newbe to proramming in Linux (experienced in C for windows/ms-dos...) I'm trying to write a deamon for my raspberri pi.
This is to monitor my usage for electicity and gas, and later will try to add a feature to measure the production of my solar panels.

I've programmed a lot for windows using C creating services using tcp/ip, RS232, PSTN, ISDN etc. 
Now more than 10 years not programming anymore i'd like to collect data from my 'smart' kwh-meter.

So i'm new to linux / raspberry... 
Also new to Github...

Idea's to help me can be sent by email koertdejong68@gmail.com
